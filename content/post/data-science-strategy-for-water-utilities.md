In my job as manager data science for a medium-sized water utility in Australia, I have developed a strategy to increased the amount of value we extract from data.

Many businesses that seek the promised benefits of Big Data don't achieve those because they don't start with the basics.

The most important data science strategy advice is to spend a lot of time getting to know and to improve data quality.

Good data science needs to comply with these four basic principles:


- **Utility:** The analysis needs to be able to improve reality, otherwise we end with 'analysis-paralysis'. Although we speak of data science, it is really data engineering because we are not seeking the truth, we seek improvement of reality.
- **Soundness:** The analysis needs to be scientifically valid so that managers can make reliable decisions.
- **Aesthetics:** Visualisations need to be pleasing to the eye, not as a beautification but to ensure users draw correct conclusions.
- **Reproducibility:** Analysts need to be able to repeat the work of other people to ensure quality control. This is where the science comes into data analytics.
